In MPEG-4 terminology, this is called the scene carousel.## BIFS Chunk Processing \n The BIFS chunk encoding mode allows encoding single BIFS access units from an initial context and a set of commands. \n The generated AUs are raw BIFS (not SL-packetized), in files called FILE-ESID-AUIDX.bifs, with FILE the basename of the input file. \n Commands with a timing of 0 in the input will modify the carousel version only (i.e. output context). \n Commands with a timing different from 0 in the input will generate new AUs. \n \n \n Options:",
