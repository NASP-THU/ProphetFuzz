    "name": "jhead",
    "description": "jhead is a tool used to display and manipulate the Exif header data of JPEG images from digital cameras. It can display camera settings in a user-friendly format, manipulate image aspects related to JPEG and Exif headers, change internal timestamps, remove thumbnails, and transfer Exif headers back into edited images. It can also launch other programs in a style similar to the UNIX find command.",
    "options": {
        "-te file": "Transplants Exif header from a JPEG in file into the manipulated image, useful for retaining Exif headers after photo editing. It also supports a 'relative path' option for specifying the thumbnail name, allowing batch file operations.",
        "-dc": "This option deletes the comment field from the JPEG header. It's important to note that the comment is not part of the Exif header.",
        "-de": "This option is used to delete the Exif header entirely. However, it leaves other metadata sections intact.",
        "-di": "This option deletes the IPTC section if it exists. All other metadata sections remain unaffected.",
        "-dx": "This option is used to delete the XMP section from the image. All other metadata sections remain unaffected.",
        "-du": "This option deletes sections of a jpeg that are not Exif, not comment, and not contributing to the image. It is useful for removing data that programs like Photoshop might leave in the image.",
        "-purejpg": "This option deletes all JPEG sections not required for rendering the image. It also strips any metadata left in the image by various applications, combining the functions of the -de, -dc, and -du options.",
        "-mkexif": "This option creates a minimal exif header, which includes date/time and empty thumbnail fields. Use with -rgt option for the exif header to contain a thumbnail.",
        "-ce": "This option allows editing of the JPEG header comment field, which can be part of Exif and non-Exif style JPEG images. A temporary file is created for the comment, a text editor is launched for editing, and after editing, the data is transferred back into the image.",
        "-cs file": "This option allows saving the comment section to a specified file.",
        "-ci file": "This option allows the user to replace the comment with text from a specified file.",
        "-cl string": "This option replaces the comment with a specified string from the command line.",
        "-ft": "This option sets the file's system time stamp to match the time stamp stored in the Exif header of the image.",
        "-dsft": "This option sets the Exif timestamp to match the file's timestamp. It requires an existing Exif header, and the -mkexif option can be used to create one if necessary.",
        "-n [format_string]": "Renames and/or moves files using date information from the Exif header 'DateTimeOriginal' field. If provided, the format_string is passed to the strftime function as the format string, with '%f' substituting the original file name and '%i' a sequence number.",
        "-ta<+|-><timediff>": "This option adjusts the time stored in the Exif header by h:mm forwards or backwards. It is useful when pictures have been taken with the wrong time set on the camera, such as after travelling across time zones or when daylight savings time has changed.",
        "-da<newdate>-<olddate>": "This option is used to specify large date offsets when correcting dates from cameras with incorrect settings. It calculates the exact number of days for the timestamp adjustment, considering leap years and daylight savings time changes.",
        "-ts": "This option sets the time stored in the Exif header to the value specified on the command line. The time must be in the format: yyyy:mm:dd-hh:mm:ss.",
        "-ds": "Sets the date in the Exif header to the specified command line input. The date can be set as full date, year and month, or just year.",
        "-dt": "This option deletes thumbnails from the Exif header, leaving the rest of the header intact. It is used to reduce space, as thumbnails typically occupy around 10k, and their removal has not been found to cause any adverse effects.",
        "-st file": "This option saves the integral thumbnail to a specified file. It also supports a 'relative path' option for batch processing, and can send the thumbnail to stdout if '-' is specified for the output file.",
        "-rt": "Replaces thumbnails in the Exif header. This function is only applicable if the Exif header already contains a thumbnail and it is at the end of the header.",
        "-rgt size": "This option is used to regenerate the exif thumbnail of an image. The 'size' parameter specifies the maximum height or width of the thumbnail and it requires the 'mogrify' program from ImageMagick.",
        "-autorot": "This option uses the 'Orientation' tag of the Exif header to rotate the image upright using the jpegtran program. After rotation, the orientation tag is set to '1' and the thumbnail is also rotated, while other Exif header fields remain unchanged.",
        "-norot": "This option clears the rotation field in the Exif header without altering the image. It is useful for resetting thumbnails and rotation tags that have become out of sync due to manipulation with various tools.",
        "-h": "Displays summary of command line options.",
        "-v": "This option makes the program more verbose, providing feedback on its operations. It is designed for users who expect feedback within short intervals, to avoid the assumption of a crash.",
        "-q": "This option suppresses output on successful execution, making it behave more like Unix programs.",
        "-V, -exifmap": "The -V option prints the version info and compilation date. The -exifmap option shows a map of the bytes in the exif header, useful for analyzing strange exif headers.",
        "-se": "This option is used to suppress error messages that are related to corrupt Exif header structure in the JPEG images.",
        "-c": "This option provides a concise, one-line summary of picture info. It is useful for grep-ing through images and importing into spreadsheets.",
        "-model": "This option restricts the processing of files to those whose camera model contains the specified substring. It is used to filter images from a specific camera model.",
        "-exonly": "This option allows jhead to skip all files without an Exif header. It is useful when dealing with photos directly from a digital camera, as many photo manipulation tools discard the Exif header.",
        "-proc": "This option allows to process only files matching a specific encoding. For instance, '-proc 0' processes only files with baseline encoding, while '-proc 2' processes only files with progressive encoding.",
        "-cmd": "Executes a specified command on each JPEG file being processed, reading the Exif section before running the command and reinserting it after the command finishes. The command is invoked separately for each JPEG processed, even if multiple files are specified."
