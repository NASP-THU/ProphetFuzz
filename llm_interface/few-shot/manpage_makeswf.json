    "description": "makeswf - actionscript compiler makeswf is a command line interface to the Ming library actionscript compiler, with support for embedding prebuilt content. \n frame_content can be either: an ActionScript source file, a bitmap file (png or jpg), or an SWF file.  Non-ActionScript input files are currently only recognized by extension (png, jpg, swf). Files with other extensions will be assumed to contain ActionScript source code. \n Each frame_content will be stored in a separate frame of the output. \n ActionScript code is preprocessed using cpp before being compiled, this allows (among many other things) grouping multiple sourcefiles into a single frame by using #include directives. (See PREPROCESSOR below.) \n Bitmap or SWF content will be stored in a MovieClip named after the corresponding input filename with path and extension removed. This allows easy referencing of the content by ActionScript code.",
